# QuantumEllipticCurves

## Overview

The Quantum Elliptic Curves project contains Q# implementations of quantum elliptic curves primitives, and can be used to obtain resource estimates for the quantum elliptic curve discrete logarithms algorithm (as described in [1]).

The project depends on version 0.11.2006.403 of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit). It can be built using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or the free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The code was developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.
