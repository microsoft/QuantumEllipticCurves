# QuantumEllipticCurves

## Overview

The Quantum Elliptic Curves project contains Q# implementations of quantum elliptic curves primitives, and can be used to obtain resource estimates for the quantum elliptic curve discrete logarithms algorithm (as described in [1]).

The project depends on version 0.11.2006.403 of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit). It can be built using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/).

The code was developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.

## Contents

The Quantum Elliptic Curves Visual Studio solution contains the following projects:

### MicrosoftQuantumCrypto

The `MicrosoftQuantumCrypto` project implements the crypographic primitives in Q# and contains unit tests that can be run using Visual Studio's Test Explorer or the .NET CLI (as demonstrated below).

To build the project (with `<CONFIG>` set to `MinimizeDepth`, `MinimizeT`, or `MinimizeWidth`):

`dotnet build -c <CONFIG> .\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto.csproj`

To run the unit tests:

`dotnet test .\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto.csproj`

+++ TODO: MORE DETAILS +++

### ResourceEstimator

+++ TODO: MORE DETAILS +++

The `ResourceEstimator` project creates quantum resource estimates for the `MicrosoftQuantumCrypto` library, using the cost metric with which the library was compiled.

To build the project (with `<CONFIG>` set to `Debug` or `Release`):

`dotnet build -c <CONFIG> .\ResourceEstimator\ResourceEstimator.csproj`

To run the estimator:

`.\ResourceEstimator\bin\<CONFIG>\netcoreapp3.1\ResourceEstimator.exe`
