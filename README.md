# QuantumEllipticCurves

The QuantumEllipticCurves project contains Q# implementations of quantum circuits for elliptic curve arithmetic and isogeny computation.

## Shor's algorithm for computing elliptic curve discrete logarithms

The code provides all operations to obtain resource estimates for quantum circuits to compute elliptic curve discrete logarithms using Shor's algorithm as described in [1] and [2]. Building on integer and modular arithmetic such as modular multiplication, squaring and inversion, the project contains circuits for adding elliptic curve points on Weierstraß curves over prime fields.

## Computing supersingular isogenies

Operations for field arithmetic of quadratic extension fields, Montgomery curve arithmetic over such fields, and circuits for 2-isogeny computations are used to construct circuits for isogeny computations on supersingular elliptic curves as used in SIDH [3] and SIKE [4]. 

The project depends on version 0.11.2006.403 of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit). It can be built using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/).

The code was developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.

## Contents

The Quantum Elliptic Curves Visual Studio solution contains the following projects:

### MicrosoftQuantumCrypto

The `MicrosoftQuantumCrypto` project implements the crypographic primitives in Q# and contains unit tests that can be run using Visual Studio's Test Explorer or the .NET CLI (as demonstrated below).

To build the project (with `<CONFIG>` set to `MinimizeDepth`, `MinimizeT`, or `MinimizeWidth`):

`dotnet build -c <CONFIG> .\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto.csproj`

To run the unit tests:

`dotnet test .\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto\MicrosoftQuantumCrypto.csproj`

+++ TODO: MORE DETAILS +++

### ResourceEstimator

+++ TODO: MORE DETAILS +++

The `ResourceEstimator` project creates quantum resource estimates for the `MicrosoftQuantumCrypto` library, using the cost metric with which the library was compiled.

To build the project (with `<CONFIG>` set to `Debug` or `Release`):

`dotnet build -c <CONFIG> .\ResourceEstimator\ResourceEstimator.csproj`

To run the estimator:

`.\ResourceEstimator\bin\<CONFIG>\netcoreapp3.1\ResourceEstimator.exe`
